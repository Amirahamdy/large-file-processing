# Large File Processing with Multi-threading in Java

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to efficiently process large CSV files using **multi-threading in Java**.
The file is split into chunks, and each thread processes a portion in parallel, improving performance.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-threaded file processing** for large datasets
- **Optimized performance** using Java `ExecutorService`
- **Scalable & efficient** parallel computing
- **Handles large CSV/Text files** without memory overload

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Multi-threading (`ExecutorService`)
- File handling (`RandomAccessFile`)

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/amirahamdy/LargeFileProcessing.git
   cd LargeFileProcessing
